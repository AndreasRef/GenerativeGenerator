# GenerativeGenerator

A simple object oriented Processing sketch for creating abstract generative visual art.

Whenever circles overlap, a straight line is drawn between their centres.

The movement of circles can either be controlled by the userâ€™s mouse, a fixed drifting pattern and random values by a GUI created in p5 Control by Andreas Schlegel.

Although simple, the program is capable of producing a wide range of different visual outputs from the emergent patterns of many small units.
